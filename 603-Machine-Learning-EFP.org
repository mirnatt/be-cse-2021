** STUDIO SESSIONS (15 sessions of 3 hours each)
/Sample Case Study/: Online booking and service system

Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 dataset from
the UCI Machine Learning Repository contains information
about 100,000 patients with diabetes treated acros 130 US
hospitals. The task is to predict whether a patient requires
readmission.

/Variants/ 
- Predict student performance in secondary education (high
  school).
1. Instructor provides the links in Internet, industry links
   and professional magazine articles available in SSN
   library and asks the students to study systems or
   industrial applications based on the fundamentals learnt.
   Students must submit a short report on various problems
   and applications, tools and knowledge required to design
   such a system.
2. The instructor introduces the general aspects of timetable
   management / scheduling problem and constraints involved. Further,
   the faculty provides pointers to applications of this problem in
   various other domains.
3. Students are grouped into teams and each team is asked to
   formulate timetable management in different domains and
   identify the scope and constraints of their problem.
4. Students are asked to evolve an architecture design along
   with the design of individual modules. They need to plan a
   timeline too.
5. Students are asked to explore safety, health, ethical,
   environmental, societal impact (whichever applicable) of
   the applications and investigate legal and ethical
   aspects. A detailed report of the problem formulation,
   scope and constraints, design must be submitted.
6. Students are asked to find out the technologies used to
   implement their work and analyze the feasibility. With the
   selected tools and technologies, they are asked to
   implement their solution.
7. Students are asked to demonstrate their solutions in two
   stages (after 50% completion and after 100% completion of
   the implementation)
8. Students are asked to present their problem, methodology,
   and solution.
9. Students are asked to document their learning experience
   as a reflection of the skills acquired.
10. Students are asked to explore limitations of their
    solution in terms of security, reliability, code
    reusability and adaptability.


\hfill *Total Hours: 30 + 15 + 45 = 90*

** COURSE OUTCOMES
After the completion of this course, students will be able
to:
1. Study requirements of problems and select suitable ML
   algorithm
2. Apply machine learning algorithms to solve problems
   with sociall and industrial relevance
3. Communicate effectively through discussions, reports and
   presentations.
4. Work in teams to develop modules and integrate them, and
   evaluate with qualitative and quantitative metrics.
5. Analyze the impact on health, safety, society, environment
   as well as underlying legal and ethical considerations
   whichever are applicable.
