#+BEGIN_COMMENT
- AU title is Machine Learning Techniques
- AU text books is Tom Mitchell. It was printed in 1997 and is not
  revised since then.
- The text book is changed to
  - Stephen Marsland, ``Machine Learning -- An Algorithmic
    Perspective''
- Unit I takes a few topics from
  - Ethem Alpaydin, ``Introduction to Machine Learning''
- The topics are accordingly changed to follow the flow of Stephen
  Marsland.
- Syllabus in M.E and B.E differs in Unit I, IV and V
