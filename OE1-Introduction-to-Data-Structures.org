|UNIT III | STACK AND QUEUE | 6 |
Stack: Array implementation of stack -- Applications: Evaluating
postfix expressions; Queue: Array implementation of queues --
Applications of queues.

|UNIT IV | TREES | 6 |
Tree: Preliminaries -- Tree traversals -- Binary Search Trees --
Binary Heaps -- Applications of trees.

|UNIT V | GRAPHS | 6 |
Graph algorithms: Definitions -- Representation of graphs -- Breadth
